# Park-o-Meter
Park-O-Meter is a text-based application that helps users discover nearby parks, rate and review park facilities, and create personalized park loops. It uses user location data to calculate distances and can sort and filter parks based on distance, ratings, and amenities.

To run the program you will need a Java IDE. java.util and java.io libraries were used.

Please note that this program was coded on Repl.it and OnlineGDB, so user may need to get Java Development Kit before running on platforms such as VSC.
